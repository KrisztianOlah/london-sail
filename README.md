===========

London Sail is a commuter application for Sailfish OS.

London Sail is a Sailfish application to help with the daily commute in the city of London, UK. Whilst the projet is open source under MIT License and therefore open for both contributions and forking* there are a few important notes regarding forking, please read them carefully and adhere to them. Also please note that some of the materials(pictures,tube map,the London Busses and LU roundels, etc) are the intellectual property of their respective owners, meaning any use of them have to adhere to their respective terms and conditions. I will do my best to indicate whenever it is the case.


*If you want to create a fork you are required to register at http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/syndication/16492.aspx In case the link would break at some point in the future search for the terms "developer area tfl".
